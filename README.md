# The Process of Making a Coat of Plates
This website is a short guide on constructing a late 14th century coat of plates.
 
A coat of plates was a type of medieval armor made up overlapping sheets of metal riveted to a fabric base. This type of armor was cheaper and easier to produce than plate armor, so it was a mainstay early on in the development of full medieval plate armor, and later being found more common with lesser soldiers. Few surviving examples remain but a mass grave dating to the Battle of Visby, 1361, has yielded armor that would be considered outdated and peasant-grade armor at the time. A Visby coat of plates is the objective of this instruction guide and would be optimal for a 14th century man-at-arms or a peasant soldier.
## Step 1: Materials
The first step in making a coat of plates is by collecting the materials and tools needed to make it. You will need:
1. Sheet steel, 20-16 gauge depending on its purpose from light reenacting to heavy combat
2. Hemp cloth
3. Cover cloth, such as leather, velvet, or just wool
4. Roofing nails
5. Leather straps and buckles
6. Ball and pean hammer
7. Two wood blocks and a rolling pin
8. Drill or hole punching machine
9. Cutting tool
10. Sanding tool
11. Safety goggles and gloves
12. Pattern (Here is a link to a few patterns from the Visby mass grave http://www.armourarchive.org/patterns/wisby/)
 
Once you have your materials you can begin construction.
## Step 2: Cutting
Trace your pattern onto the sheet metal and begin cutting. Be patient and do not rush it. If you are too keen to cut quickly you could cut off course and into the wrong places. After you are finished cutting, sand the edges until they are smooth and no longer sharp.
